# Creation of Embeddings
efficient-net.ipynb has the required code to generate embeddings from images. Generate required embeddings from the dataset which gives a .npy file with all embedings. Some pretrained embedings can be found in https://drive.google.com/file/d/151cQx0cGmhsa_5G9MawodpYA5B-obCcx/view?usp=sharing.

# Training and Testing
Use the recommender.ipynb to train and test the embeddings data
